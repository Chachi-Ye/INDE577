# INDE577 Data Science and Machine Learning
Writer: Chaoqi Ye

## Course Description

This data science course taught at Rice University during the Spring 2022 semester covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch, but will also make use of the Skikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries.

## Repository Description
For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset/images files (if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python 3.

The following topics have been covered in class:

- Data Science Practices:

    Python Programming
    Jupyter Notebooks
    Visual Studio Code
