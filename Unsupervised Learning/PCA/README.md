## Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

## Objectives

In this project, we will implement Principal Component Analysis with the classification dataset. We will also show an example of PCA with the breast cancer data from sklearn package.

## Data

### The Classification dataset

The dataset used for this model is a public data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveneschlbeck/beginners-classification-dataset

The dataset contains only three columns:

age

interest: the value of how people are interested in learning new sport

success: "1" represents success, "0" represents fail.
 
The content can be applied to various things, e.g. how successful different people learn new sports.

### The breast cancer dataset

Load from sklearn.datasets.
