## Neural Networks

Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.

## Objectives

In this project, I will build a L-Layer Neural Networks model from scratch by using the gradient descent algorith to check if the predictions are same as the actual digital.

## Data

The dataset used for this model is a public data from Kaggle, kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset.

Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use manual communication to convey meaning. This can include simultaneously employing hand gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas.
