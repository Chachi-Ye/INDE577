By: Chaoqi Ye

## Objectives
---
In this part, we will explore the single neuron model - perceptrons on a dataset called "gender_classification".

## Data

The dataset used for this model is a public data from Kaggle kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset?select=gender_classification_v7.csv. 

This dataset contains 7 features and a label column.

longhair - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "long hair" and 0 is "not long hair".

foreheadwidthcm - This column is in CM's. This is the width of the forehead.

foreheadheightcm - This is the height of the forehead and it's in Cm's.

nosewide - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "wide nose" and 0 is "not wide nose".

noselong - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "Long nose" and 0 is "not long nose".

lipsthin - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "thin lips" while 0 is "Not thin lips".

distancenosetoliplong - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "long distance between nose and lips" while 0 is "short distance between nose and lips".

gender - This is either "Male" or "Female".
