## Single Neuron Model

By: Chaoqi Ye

## Objectives

In this part, we will explore the single neuron model - perceptrons on a dataset called "gender_classification".

## Data

The dataset used for this model is a public data from Kaggle kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset?select=gender_classification_v7.csv. 

This dataset contains 7 features and a label column.

Longhair - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "long hair" and 0 is "not long hair".

Foreheadwidthcm - This column is in CM's. This is the width of the forehead.

Foreheadheightcm - This is the height of the forehead and it's in Cm's.

Nosewide - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "wide nose" and 0 is "not wide nose".

Noselong - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "Long nose" and 0 is "not long nose".

Lipsthin - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "thin lips" while 0 is "Not thin lips".

Distancenosetoliplong - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "long distance between nose and lips" while 0 is "short distance between nose and lips".

Gender - This is either "Male" or "Female".
