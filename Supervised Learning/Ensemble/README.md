## Ensemble - Bagging, Random Forests and Boosting

Ensemble learning is a general meta approach to machine learning that seeks better predictive performance by combining the predictions from multiple models.

The three main classes of ensemble learning methods are bagging, random forests(stacking) and boosting.

## Objectives

In this project, we will implement bagging, random forests and boosting model with the classification data by the Scikit-learn package. We will also compare precisions of those and the precisions of decision tree model AND the decision regions of them.

## Data

The dataset used for this model is a public data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveneschlbeck/beginners-classification-dataset

The dataset contains only three columns:

age

interest: the value of how people are interested in learning new sport

success: "1" represents success, "0" represents fail.
 
The content can be applied to various things, e.g. how successful different people learn new sports.
