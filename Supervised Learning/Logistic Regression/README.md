## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some of the examples of classification problems are Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign. Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value.

## Objectives

In this project, I will build a logistic regression model by using the gradient descent algorith to check if the predictions are same as the actual data.

## Data

The dataset used for this model is a public data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveneschlbeck/beginners-classification-dataset

The dataset contains only three columns:

age

interest: the value of how people are interested in learning new sport

success: "1" represents success, "0" represents fail.
 
The content can be applied to various things, e.g. how successful different people learn new sports.
